# nodejs-playground [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nodejs)](https://skillicons.dev)

I created this repository to learn Node.js in practice and streamline the process of saving and tracking my progress on GitHub. Each folder represents a small project or challenge. There is no formality or strong concern with security, as all the projects in this repository are solely intended to serve as a personal learning log for Node.js and its ecosystem.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> More details about each project can be found in the folderâ€™s README.
